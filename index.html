		<h3>Congratulations on wanting to start your own iPhone App Company!</h3>
		<p>This website was created in order to be a resource to help you understand the process of forming a company and the issues surrounding it. While the potential for future rewards is immense, forming a company can be extremely complicated, costly and time consuming.  Fortunately, with the right knowledge and preparation these concerns can be managed.  </p>

   	    <p>My personal experience involves forming a small iPhone App software company as an S Corp in the State of Florida.  I’m also a Certified Public Accountant with Bachelors and Masters Degrees in accounting.</p>

	    <p>Before the company can be formed a few topics need to be addressed:</p>

	    <pre> HOW CAN WE CHANGE FONT?
	    Company Name
	    Founders
	    Business Plan
	    Business Structure Selection
	    Legal Process of Forming a Company
	    Separation of Company and Personal Business
	    Operating a Business Bank Account and Credit Card
	    Accounting Basis
	    Bookkeeping and Accounting
	    Taxes
		</pre>

<h3>Company Name</h3>

<p>Selecting a company name is important as it is the sometimes the first impression a customer will receive.  The name should be unique, applicable to the product or service you are selling and easily remembered.  You should consider how it will be spelled and will sound orally.  Also, if you plan to have a website, determine if a domain name is available.  There are several websites available where you can search to see if a domain name exists.  I recommend purchasing the domain name prior to registering the company as some unscrupulous individuals look for newly registered companies to purchase similar domain names and then try to sell them back to you at a profit.</p>

<h3>Founders</h3>

<p>If forming your company with more than one person, each founder’s role and percentage of equity will need to be clearly stated in a contract.  It’s very important to get everything in writing.</p>

<h3>Business Plan</h3>

<p>A business plan helps focus you on strategic areas in order to see the strengths and weaknesses in your business.  Some key components of a business plan are below:
<p>•	How you will collect money.  (Pay Pal is an option – see if you can do an affiliate link)</p>
<p>•	Market opportunities</p>
<p>•	Pricing Strategy</p>
<p>•	Advertising and marketing plan</p>
<p>•	Breakeven analysis</p>
<p>•	Company’s Strengths and Core Competencies</p>
<p>•	What will make the company succeed</p>
</h3>

<h3>Business Structure Selection</h3>

<p>There are generally five types of entities your company can be and each has its own unique tax and accounting considerations.  Your form of business determines which income tax return form you have to file and the amount of liability you have.  There are a number of legal and tax concerns that should be taken into account when selecting your business structure.  It is possible to form a company on your own, but you may want to consult with a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or attorney to assist you in your decision. Per the IRS, below are the basics to provide you with a general overview of each.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><em>Sole Proprietorships</em>: Sole proprietor is someone who owns an unincorporated business by himself or herself.</li>
		<li>Jamie is a wonderful wife</li>
	</ul>

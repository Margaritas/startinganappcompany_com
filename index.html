		<h3>Congratulations on wanting to start your own iPhone App Company!</h3>
		<p>This website was created in order to be a resource to help you understand the process of forming a company and the issues surrounding it. While the potential for future rewards is immense, forming a company can be extremely complicated, costly and time consuming.  Fortunately, with the right knowledge and preparation these concerns can be managed.  </p>

   	    <p>My personal experience involves forming a small iPhone App software company as an S Corp in the State of Florida.  I’m also a Certified Public Accountant with Bachelors and Masters Degrees in accounting.</p>

	    <p>Before the company can be formed a few topics need to be addressed:</p>

<a name="Company Name"></a>
<h3>Company Name</h3>

<p>Selecting a company name is important as it is the sometimes the first impression a customer will receive.  The name should be unique, applicable to the product or service you are selling and easily remembered.  You should consider how it will be spelled and will sound orally.  Also, if you plan to have a website, determine if a domain name is available.  There are several websites available where you can search to see if a domain name exists.  I recommend purchasing the domain name prior to registering the company as some unscrupulous individuals look for newly registered companies to purchase similar domain names and then try to sell them back to you at a profit.</p>

<a name="Founders"></a>
<h3>Founders</h3>

<p>If forming your company with more than one person, each founder’s role and percentage of equity will need to be clearly stated in a contract.  It’s very important to get everything in writing.</p>
<a href="#Back to Top">Back to Top</a>

<a name="Business Plan"></a>
<h3>Business Plan</h3>

<p>A business plan helps focus you on strategic areas in order to see the strengths and weaknesses in your business.  Some key components of a business plan are below:
	<ul>
		<li>Market opportunities</li>
		<li>Pricing Strategy</li>
		<li>Advertising and marketing plan</li>
		<li>Breakeven analysis</li>
		<li>Company’s Strengths and Core Competencies</li>
		<li>What will make the company succeed</li>
	</ul>

<a name="Business Structure Selection"></a>
<h3>Business Structure Selection</h3>

<p>There are generally five types of entities your company can be and each has its own unique tax and accounting considerations.  Your form of business determines which income tax return form you have to file and the amount of liability you have.  There are a number of legal and tax concerns that should be taken into account when selecting your business structure.  It is possible to form a company on your own, but you may want to consult with a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or attorney to assist you in your decision. Per the IRS, below are the basics to provide you with a general overview of each.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><em>Sole Proprietorships</em>: Sole proprietor is someone who owns an unincorporated business by himself or herself.<br><br></li>
		<li><em>Partnerships</em>: A partnership is the relationship existing between two or more persons who join to carry on a trade or business. Each person contributes money, property, labor or skill, and expects to share in the profits and losses of the business.  A partnership must file an annual information return to report the income, deductions, gains, losses, etc., from its operations, but it does not pay income tax. Instead, it "passes through" any profits or losses to its partners. Each partner includes his or her share of the partnership's income or loss on his or her tax return.  Partners are not employees and should not be issued a Form W-2.<br><br></li>
		<li><em>Corporations</em>: In forming a corporation, prospective shareholders exchange money, property, or both, for the corporation's capital stock. A corporation generally takes the same deductions as a sole proprietorship to figure its taxable income. A corporation can also take special deductions. For federal income tax purposes, a C corporation is recognized as a separate taxpaying entity. A corporation conducts business, realizes net income or loss, pays taxes and distributes profits to shareholders.  The profit of a corporation is taxed to the corporation when earned, and then is taxed to the shareholders when distributed as dividends. This creates a double tax. The corporation does not get a tax deduction when it distributes dividends to shareholders. Shareholders cannot deduct any loss of the corporation.<br><br></li>
		<li><em>S Corporations</em>: S corporations are corporations that elect to pass corporate income, losses, deductions and credit through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes. Shareholders of S corporations report the flow-through of income and losses on their personal tax returns and are assessed tax at their individual income tax rates. This allows S corporations to avoid double taxation on the corporate income. S corporations are responsible for tax on certain built-in gains and passive income.  To qualify for S corporation status, the corporation must meet the following requirements:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Be a domestic corporation</li>
				<li>Have only allowable shareholders including individuals, certain trust, and estates and may not include partnerships, corporations or non-resident alien shareholders</li>
				<li>Have no more than 100 shareholders</li>
				<li>Have one class of stock</li>
				<li>Not be an ineligible corporation i.e. certain financial institutions, insurance companies, and domestic international sales corporations.</li>
			</ul>		
		<li><em>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</em>: A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a business structure allowed by state statute. LLCs are popular because, similar to a corporation, owners have limited personal liability for the debts and actions of the LLC. Other features of LLCs are more like a partnership, providing management flexibility and the benefit of pass-through taxation.  The federal government does not recognize an LLC as a classification for federal tax purposes. An LLC business entity must file as a corporation, partnership or sole proprietorship tax return.</li>
			</ul>

<p>In my opinion C Corporation, Partnership and sole proprietor entities are typically not logical choices for an iPhone application company as they didn’t offer enough liability protection or had double taxation.  An S Corp or an LLC were the best choices. </p>

<a name="Legal Process of Forming a Company"></a>
<h3>Legal Process of Forming Company</h3>

<p>Once these topics have been addressed, you may proceed with the actual legal process of forming the company.  My experience has been in the State of Florida so this will be directed towards that State, although other states may have a similar process.  </p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Register your company at your state's Division of Corporations. Florida's is <a href="http://www.sunbiz.org/">Sunbiz.org</a>.  Be careful of websites that claim to be related to the valid website.  There will be related fees and paperwork required to be submitted.</li>
		<li>Apply for your company’s EIN number on the IRS’s website.  If electing S Corp status, the corporation must submit Form 2553 Election by a Small Business Corporation signed by all the shareholders.  You cannot open a business bank account without this EIN number.</li>
		<li>Check with you city and county to see any registration requirements.</li>
	</ul>

<a name="Separation of Company and Personal Business"></a>		
<h3>Separation of Company and Personal Business</h3>

<p>It is extremely important to keep your personal and business actions and funds separate.  Funds should not be comingled; therefore personal bank accounts or credit cards should not be used to pay for business expenses.  In the event of a lawsuit, the comingling of assets allows the argument that the corporate veil has been pierced and your liability will no longer be limited to just the company.  From a tax perspective, it provides the IRS an argument that your business expenses are personal in nature and may not be valid to deduct from the businesses revenue.  All company correspondence should be to your company’s email address, not your personal one.</p>

<a name="Opening a Business Bank Account and Credit Card"></a>
<h3>Opening a Business Bank Account and Credit Card</h3>

<p>Once you have your EIN number from the IRS you may open a business bank account.  There are many options and some banks can even be found with zero fees.  Some examples are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>PNC Bank – LINK</li>
		<li>BAC Bank - LINK</li>
	</ul>	
	
<p>There are also several business credit card options, such as:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Chase – LINK</li>
		<li>Other Affiliate LINKS</li>
	</ul>

<a name="Accounting Basis"></a>	
<h3>Accounting Basis</h3>

<p>Will your business be cash or accrual basis?  Under the cash method, income and expenses are not counted until cash is actually received or paid out.  Under the accrual method, transactions are recorded when it occurs without regard to when the cash is received or paid.  If you plan to keep your own books and are new to accounting, I recommend the cash basis.  The accrual method is difficult to use due to having to rely on Apple’s monthly sales reports and international exchange rates.</p>
<a href="#Back to Top">Back to Top</a>

<a name="Bookkeeping and Accounting"></a>
<h3>Bookkeeping and Accounting</h3>

<p>There are many tax and accounting responsibilities associated with having your own company.  Depending on your circumstances, you may need to hire an accountant or choose to perform your own bookkeeping and tax preparation.  Hiring an accountant may be expensive, but necessary.  If you choose to do so, ensure they are a Certified Public Accountant and have experience with companies similar to yours.  If you choose to do the bookkeeping yourself, there are several bookkeeping software programs that can be utilized such as:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Quickbooks – LINK (I personally use this program.)</li>
		<li>Bookkeeper- LINK</li>
		<li>Sage 50 Complete Accounting - LINK</li>
		<li>AccountEdge - LINK</li>
	</ul>	
	
<p>Books such as the ones listed below can be found on how to use these programs.  YouTube even features several videos for free that demonstrates the software’s capabilities.</p>

<a name="Taxes"></a>	
<h3>Taxes</h3>

<p>The IRS tax code is hundreds upon hundreds of pages and this website will only be able to provide summarized information on a small portion of the applicable guidelines.  A CPA may be necessary to file your taxes; however, if you do chose to prepare your own company’s taxes I recommend Turbo Tax (AFFILIATE LINK).  You should have an overall understanding of the applicable guidelines and rules that affect your business.  Several information books can be found on the subject:</p>
